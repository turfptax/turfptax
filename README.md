🔬 Creator of [**OpenMuscle**](https://github.com/Open-Muscle/OpenMuscle-Hub)

**OpenMuscle** is a modular, open-source prosthetic sensing platform.  
It detects finger movements using custom pressure sensors and machine learning — no EMG required.

> Imagine a future where anyone can build their own prosthetic interface. That’s what OpenMuscle is here to enable.
