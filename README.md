- 👋 Hi, I’m @turfptax
- 👀 I’m interested in open-source machine learning for prosthetics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source sensor technologies

openmuscle is my passion. An open-source prosethic sensor suite that detects finger movements by machine learning and sampling topology changes in the forearm.
